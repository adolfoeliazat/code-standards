# Code Standards

This repository contains a set of code standards and guidelines, along with a few helpful resources.
These standards are part of the [@wearebase](https://github.com/wearebase) code quality assurance process.

Please note: This document is biased towards PHP and JavaScript, which are the most common languages we currently use. Much of it should apply to other languages (such as Objective-C, Java, Python and Ruby) however if an existing industry standard is in widespread use then it should be preferred. Wherever possible we try to follow industry standards.

## Files and formatting

* Save files as UTF-8
* UNIX-style line endings. (`git` should take care of this for you if you use Windows)
* Indent using 4 spaces. This is the standard for PHP. Your editor can make this seamless for you.
* Lowercase filenames, without any punctuation apart from `-` and `.` (except where this contradicts with another standard)


## Comments

* Comment what is not obvious


## Source control (eg `git`)

* Large changes to whitespace should be in their own commit


## Passwords

* Use industry best practices for storing passwords safely. We currently use [bcrpyt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) to store user passwords in databases (for example, [wp_bcrypt](https://github.com/dxw/wp_bcrypt) for WordPress).
* User login forms should be protected against remote brute force attacks (for example, [Login LockDown](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-lockdown/) for WordPress).
* Passwords must be "strong", meaning they have an [entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Random_passwords) of at least 56 bits. This is approximately equal to a password with 12 lowercase characters or a password with 9 mixed-case alphanumeric characters.


## Security

* Industry best practices should be followed for security
* Never trust any type of user data
* Remove services such as FTP, which transfer data unencrypted, and instead use secure services such as SFTP.
* Private SSH keys should have pass-phrases


## PHP

* PHP code must have no syntax errors (check with `php -l filename.php`)
* Use [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) or the frameworkâ€™s class autoloader when loading classes
* Follow [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) to the letter with all new code and when updating legacy code
* Follow [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md), except when working with legacy files
* Try not to mix PHP with HTML


## SQL

* Use use [parameterized queries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-in-php) whenever possible


## JavaScript

* JavaScript code must not show errors on [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/)
* 4 spaces, not tabs (to be consistent with PHP)


## CSS (and SCSS/Less)

* Formatting
    * 4 spaces, not tabs (to be consistent with PHP)
    * A space to the left of `{` and a newline after
    * Rules on new lines, with a space after `:`
    * `}` on its own
* SASS comments (`//`) instead of CSS comments (`/* ... */`)
* Prefer class selectors (`.`) and avoid id selectors (`#`)
* Comment where styles are used if it is not obvious
* CSS hacks should be avoided and documented if they are ever used (use [conditional classes on the html element](http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/) instead)


## HTML

* `.class-names-lowercase-with-dashes`
* `#ids-lowercase-with-dashes`
* HTML5 doctype: `<!doctype html>`
* HTML should be mostly valid


## Performance

* Compress images and other assets for the web
* Follow [YSlow rules](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html)
* Follow [Google Page speed rules](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rules_intro)
